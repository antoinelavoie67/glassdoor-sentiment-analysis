# Employee Satisfaction Analysis (Glassdoor)
## Overview
This repository contains a project focused on analyzing Glassdoor reviews to identify key factors influencing job satisfaction, including diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI), work-life balance, and company culture. The analysis utilizes various machine learning techniques to predict overall satisfaction and provide actionable insights for stakeholders.
